Steps: 

1. Read and explore the given dataset.  (Rename column/add headers, plot histograms, find data characteristics) 
2. Clean dataset to make it less sparse. ( For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or more number of ratings )  
3. Split the data randomly into train and test dataset. ( split it in 70/30 ratio) 
4. Build Popularity Recommender model for cold start case.  
5. Build Collaborative Filtering model based on best cross validated score. 
6. Evaluate both the models.  Once the model is trained on the training data, it can be used to compute the error (RMSE) on predictions made on the test data.  
7. Get top - K ( K = 5) recommendations.  
8. Summarise your insights.
